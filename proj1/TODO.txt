Project description: (Group #5) 

k-NN classifiers: investigate the detrimental effect of irrelevant attributes. 
Method: create some absolutely clean datafile where you know all attributes are relevant;
then, keep adding groups of randomly generated attributes. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created this file for us to use to communicate ideas, updates, and things that need to 
be accomplished for the project. As of right now:

   * We need to decide on a dataset to use. Numeric? Discrete? Do we make it up?
   * How will we measure the number of irrelevant attributes? What is the hypothesis?  
   * The program will be written in Python. With matplotlib, we can easily graph our
     results live.
